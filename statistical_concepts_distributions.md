Gaussian or Normal
{: .label .label-Blue}

<p align = "justify">
The Gaussian or Normal distribution is by far one of the most important probability distributions in literature, and it is used in many fields of engineering and science due to its simplicity and convenience. This distribution is used to model the Poisson's ratio, among other material properties, for example <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. It is possible to say that a random variable \(X\) has a Gaussian distribution if its probability density function follows the expression presented in <a href="#eq1">Equation 1</a>.

Where the parameters of the distribution \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) denote the mean and standard deviation of the variable \(X\), respectively, and \(X\) is identified as \(N(\mu,\sigma)\). The location (\(\mu\)) and scale (\(\sigma\)) parameters generate a family of distributions, as a presented in <a href="#fig1"> Figure 1</a>.

Lognormal
{: .label .label-Blue}


<p align = "justify">
The lognormal distribution (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) performs an important role for engineering in general, since such function is only defined for positive values and there are a large number of physical phenomena that cannot be negative. This distribution can be applied to describe earthquakes distribution, structural failure due to fatigue, material resistance, the yield strength of steel, among others for instance <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.<br>
Suppose a sample of random variable \(X = x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}, ..., x_{n}\) and that the natural logarithms of \(X\) values will be taken, defining a new variable \(Y = \ln{x_{1}},\ln{x_{2}},\ln{x_{3}}, ..., \ln{x_{n}}\). If the variable \(Y\) follows a Normal distribution, then \(X\) is a variable with a lognormal distribution. In other words, if the logarithms of the values of the random variable follow a Normal distribution, then the variable follows a lognormal distribution.<br>
Thus, it is possible to say that a random variable \(X\) has a lognormal distribution if its probability density function is characterized by <a href="#eq2"> Equation 2</a>.

Extreme Value or Gumbel
{: .label .label-Blue}


<p align = "justify">
The extreme value distribution is used to represent the maximum or minimum of a number of samples of various distributions. There are three types of extreme value distributions, namely Type I, Type II, and Type III. The Type I extreme value distribution, also referred to as the Gumbel distribution, is the distribution of the maximum or minimum of a number of samples of normally distributed data.
<br>The density function of the Type I extreme value distribution is defined by

Where \(\alpha\)  and \(u\) are scale and location parameters, respectively.

Similar to the relationship between the Gaussian distribution and lognormal distribution, the Type II extreme value distribution, also referred to as the Frechet distribution, can be derived by using parameters \(u = \ln{v}\), \(\alpha=k\) in the Type I distribution. The Probability Density Function of the Type II extreme value distribution is

The density functions of the Type I and Type II extreme value distributions are shown in Figure 2.7. The following subsection will discuss the last type of the extreme value distribution, the Type III extreme value distribution, also known as the Weibull distribution.

Weibull
{: .label .label-Blue}

<p align = "justify">
The Weibull distribution (Figure 2.8), also referred to as the Type III extreme value distribution, is well suited for describing the weakest link phenomena, or a situation where there are competing flaws contributing to failure. It is often used to describe fatigue, fracture of brittle materials, and strength in composites. The distribution of wind speeds at a given location on Earth can also be described with this distribution.
